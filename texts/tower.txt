<p>The Hwa Chong Clock Tower was gazetted as a national monument on 19 March 1999, 2 days before Hwa Chongâ€™s 80th anniversary, to mark the institution's role of being the first Chinese-medium secondary school catering to the Chinese community in the region. During World War 2, the Allied Forces first used the Clock Tower as their headquarters, while the Japanese subsequently used it as a vantage point and surveillance post. The four clocks of the clocktower were previously destroyed during the war. They underwent restoration in 1970 with parts generously donated by Seiko.</p>
