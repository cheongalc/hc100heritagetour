<p>The Central Plaza is known for its yellow walls and horseshoe oriental design, and is thus known as  黄城 (or “yellow city”). In 1987, the campus building was declared structurally unsound, and the entire school had to evacuate. The school operated at temporary locations at Woodlands, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Bukit Batok, before finally moving back to the Bukit Timah campus in 1992. Today, the Central Plaza is used for morning assemblies and is the school’s main teaching block. It is also the venue for major celebrations, including the Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival Celebrations, which are deemed as annual homecoming for Hwa Chong alumni.</p>
