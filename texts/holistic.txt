<p>The Holistic Education Centre was officially opened by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, on 21 March 2018, as part of Hwa Chong’s 99th anniversary celebrations. The Indoor Sports Hall is installed with translucent Kalwall panels to allow natural sunlight to illuminate the Hall's interior, hence lessening the need for artificial lighting. Additionally, the irrigation system channels rainwater from the roof to the perimeter drains, and is then filtered and stored in a massive underground tank for later use, thus making this building very environmentally-sustainable. This block is now used for co-curricular activities and classes. The water feature with the characters “饮水思源”, in front of the Holistic Education Centre, was conceptualized by Mr Desmond Ong, our former Chairman of the Board of Governors.</p>
