<p>As a tribute, Mr Lee Kong Chian named this building after his father, Mr Lee Kuo Chuan. The latter used to work as a tailor in Singapore, and he facilitated his son’s arrival in Singapore. The Kuo Chuan House was originally known as the Kuo Chuan Science Block and used to hold the science laboratories until its renovation. Now, it has a Heritage Centre which boasts a collection of Hwa Chong Institution’s historical artifacts, and will house the Centennial Art Gallery at Level 1 in commemoration of HC100.</p>
