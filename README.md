# hc100heritagetour

This is an archival copy of the companion site created for Hwa Chong Institution's 100th Anniversary Heritage Tour, held on 9 March 2019. The website can be statically served without any server-side code.

Key features include:
- The website is bilingual. 
- The website was designed to be used only on mobile devices, because participants used their phones to access the site during the tour. Hence, if you were to view the website on a desktop, you would see a dialog proompting you to view the website on a mobile device. You can get around this dialog by going into Inspect Element and changing the screen size to a mobile device size.
- The website displays a list of landmarks included in the tour and sorts this list accordring to the user's current proximity to the landmark. 
- The website also includes an interactive map of Hwa Chong Institution's campus.
- During the actual tour on 9 March 2019, the website had a guestbook which allowed participants to leave messages. The data was stored on a Firebase application. This feature was removed from this archival version for security reasons.

During the event, Member of Parliament Baey Yam Keng also gave a speech.
